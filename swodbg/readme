CMSIS provides for Cortex-M3 / Cortex-M4 processor based microcontrollers 
debug support via the Instrumented Trace Macrocell (ITM).

The Cortex-M3 incorporates the Instrumented Trace Macrocell (ITM) that
provides together with the Serial Viewer Output trace capabilities for 
the microcontroller system. The ITM has 32 communication channels which 
are able to transmit 32 / 16 / 8 bit values; two ITM communication 
channels are used by CMSIS to output the following information:

	ITM Channel 0: used for printf-style output via the debug interface.
	ITM Channel 31: is reserved for RTOS kernel awareness debugging.

ITM_SendChar(ch) is used to transmit a character over ITM channel 0 from 
the microcontroller system to the debug system.
Only a 8 bit value is transmitted.

Generally a GDB client does not support SWO. But luckily, 
the J-Link GDB server is able to work around this and send SWO data to a socket. 

If not set differently, J-Link GDB Server will use default settings:

Telnet port: 2331
SWO data port: 2332

Step-by-step guide:
---------------------------------------------
1 Open a command line GDB client
2 Connect to the J-Link GDB Server. This can be achieved via these commands:
	
	target remote :2331
	monitor SWO EnableTarget 160000000 75000 1 0
	c
Syntax
SWO EnableTarget <CPUFreq[Hz]> <SWOFreq[Hz]> <PortMask[0x01-0xFFFFFFFF] <Mode[0]>
	
3 Then start telnet with these options:

	telnet 127.0.0.1 2332
